# Memory of the past

You do not remember the past. 
So you have an accurate objective record of the past. 

That's actually impossible because you can't have a comprehensive record of the past. 
You remember the past so that you can:
1. **duplicate what was good about it in the future** and
2. **avoid what was bad about it in the future**. 

And that means you have to have derived the appropriate moral which is the point from the outcome.
And so it's very useful to bring your narrative up to date. 

Then you know where you are. 
Once you know where you are, you can plot your future.

Songified:

(Verse 1)
You think your memory is a photograph
An objective, perfect, accurate path
But a total record's an impossible dream
Things are never quite the way they seem

(Chorus)
'Cause you don't remember just to see what's done
You remember for the race that's yet to run!
You keep the good to make it live anew
And you learn from the bad to see you through!
Yeah, the memory of the past is your guide for the future you face!

(Verse 2)
From every outcome, there's a lesson learned
A moral of the story, a bridge that's burned
Or a bridge to build, a point to derive
Itâ€™s how you update, it's how you stay alive

(Chorus)
'Cause you don't remember just to see what's done
You remember for the race that's yet to run!
You keep the good to make it live anew
And you learn from the bad to see you through!
Yeah, the memory of the past is your guide for the future you face!

(Bridge)
Bring your narrative up to today
Let the meaning of it light your way
And when the story's finally up to date...
That's when you know your place, you know your fate!

(Outro)
'Cause once you know just where you are...
You can plot a course to any star.
Once you know right where you stand...
You can draw the map across the land.
Yeah, you can plan your future...
You can plan your future... right from where you stand.
