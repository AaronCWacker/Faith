You do not remember the past. 
So you have an accurate objective record of the past. 

That's actually impossible because you can't have a comprehensive record of the past. 
You remember the past so that you can duplicate what was good about it in the future and avoid what was bad about it in the future. 

And that means you have to have derived the appropriate moral which is the point from the outcome.
And so it's very useful to bring your narrative up to date. 

Then you know where you are. 
Once you know where you are, you can plot your future.
